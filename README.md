# Python-Youtube-Downloader

## Description
As for my first real hands-on experience on developing an application with Python. I built a simple GUI Python application, using Visual Studio Code, that lets user download videos from YouTube of their choice and save it locally into your machine. 

## What I learned
This was my first ever Python project. This project allowed me to make my first step to get into the Python field and increased my interest in learning more Python. I also learned new things such as implementing PIP, which is a Python package manager to use modules specific for my project.
